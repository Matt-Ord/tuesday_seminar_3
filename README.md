# Tuesday Seminar: Characterizing a Quantum Environment

When simulating diffusion of a classical particle coupled to an environment, we
don't usually care about the exact state of the environment. Instead, we use a
stochastic force to represent the interactions between the particle and it's
surroundings. This force is characterized by a correlation function that captures the
essential statistical properties of the environment.

In this talk, we explore how to extend this idea to quantum systems. We introduce the
concept of a "field operator" to represent the influence of a quantum environment on a
system. Similar to the classical stochastic force, the field operator is characterized by
its correlation functions, which encapsulate the statistical properties of the quantum
environment.

We discuss how to calculate these correlation functions and how they can be used to
simulate the dynamics of both a quantum and a classical system coupled to a quantum environment.
